# Claude Configuration

This file contains configuration and context for Claude Code to help with this project.

## Project Overview

Data analysis, statistics, and visualization project for PhD research.
Scripts should be concise and suitable for scientific publications/appendices.

## Development Commands

<!-- Add common commands used in this project -->
<!-- Example:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter
-->

## Project Structure

<!-- Describe the main directories and files -->

## Project Rules

- Write very concise code
- Minimize comments
- Use short variable names where clear
- Prefer one-liners when readable
- Avoid verbose explanations
- Use pandas method chaining
- Vectorize operations (avoid loops)
- Use numpy/pandas built-ins
- Prefer functional style (map, apply, lambda)
- Direct data transformations
- Seaborn/matplotlib for plots
- Quick EDA: df.describe(), df.info()
- Statistical tests from scipy.stats
- Minimal plot styling
- Export plots directly (plt.savefig)
- Use groupby for aggregations
- One-line statistics (mean, std, corr)
- Work in single script (no new files)
- Add to existing code, don't create separate scripts
- Always separate the code in clear sections
